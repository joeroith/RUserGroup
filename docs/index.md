# Welcome to the St. Kate's R User Group!

This is a community of faculty, staff, and students who are dedicated to furthering and sharing their knowledge of the statistical analysis software R. We are open to everyone at St. Kate's and encourage those who are curious about joining to email [Joe Roith](jmroith@stkate.edu). 

## Installing R and RStudio.

If you are new to R, here are some links to get started.

[Download R](https://www.r-project.org/). This is the software that performs all of the analysis and does the heavy lifting.

[Download RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/). This is a software that lets you use R in a much cleaner, more user friendly environment.


> If you would like more help and instructions to download both programs [read this](R_download_data_importing.pdf).

## RStudio in Stat 1090

These are some of the documents I have used in my Intro Stats classes. I expect my students to be able to perform this analysis in StatCrunch through MyStatLab, but not in RStudio. I give them an introduction to statistical coding and give them some basic tools. You may still see students ask about these techniques.

1. [Basic R Code](BasicRcode.pdf)
2. [Using R with the Normal Distribution](Rnormal.pdf)
3. [Survey Data](responses.csv)
4. [Survey Responses in RStudio](SurveyResponses.RData)

## Tutorials

These are some tutorials that I have created for my more advanced classes. Feel free to look them over if you would like more technical information about R and RStudio.

1. [Introduction to R](IntroR1.pdf)
2. [Tutorial 1](RTutorial_1.pdf)
3. [Tutorial 2](RTutorial_2.pdf)
4. [Tutorial 3](RTutorial_3.pdf)

## More Tutorials and Help

I highly reccomend trying the [Swirl](http://swirlstats.com/) tutorial in RStudio to get hands-on practice.
Also, consider Googling "How to _________ in R". There are tons of resources online with examples of code.

Contact me if you have any questions. jmroith@stkate.edu


### Have fun with RStudio!!

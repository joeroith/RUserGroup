# Welcome to the St. Kate's R User Group!

This is a community of faculty, staff, and students who are dedicated to furthering and sharing their knowledge of the statistical analysis software R. We are open to everyone at St. Kate's and encourage those who are curious about joining to email Joe Roith, jmroith@stkate.edu. 

## First Meeting, Sep. 4, 2018
Follow along with the [slides](FirstMeeting_Slides_nopic.pptx)

## Installing R and RStudio.

If you are new to R, here are some links to get started.

[Download R](https://www.r-project.org/). This is the software that performs all of the analysis and does the heavy lifting.

[Download RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/). This is a software that lets you use R in a much cleaner, more user friendly environment.


>> If you would like more help and instructions to download both programs [read this](R_download_data_importing.pdf).

## Learning How to Code in R

R is a free and open software, which means there are thousands of tutorials, websites, blogs, discussion forums, examples, and packages to help you learn how to program in the best way possible for you. Here I have included some of the tutorials I created and use in my own intermediate and upper level courses. Be aware that this is a very traditional way to be introduced to programming. It goes down into the details of the language. If you would like something more interactive, check out the **Interactive Tutorials** below.

0. [Introduction to R](IntroR1.pdf)
1. [Tutorial 1](RTutorial_1.pdf)
2. [Tutorial 2](RTutorial_2.pdf)
3. [Tutorial 3](RTutorial_3.pdf)

## Interactive Tutorials

I highly reccomend trying the [Swirl](http://swirlstats.com/) tutorial in RStudio to get hands-on practice.
Or taking the free introductory R programming course through [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/free-introduction-to-r)

## More Helpful Resources
### Web
The website [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) is a great place to ask and answer R questions.
[Cross Validated](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/r) is another good one.
Also, consider Googling "How to _________ in R". Or viewing Youtube videos. There are tons of resources online with examples of code.

### Textbooks
*The R Book* by Michael Crawley is a classic resource.
*R for Data Science* is a newer book written by Hadley Wickham, the Chief Scientist at RStudio. Even better is that you can get free online access [here](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/)

### R
Dont forget, R has its own help documentation in the software. It is not the easiest to read if you are new, so I recommend one of the above options first.

## Cheat Sheats
There are plenty of summary sheets available online for coding in R. It is not expected that you memorize *ALL* of the specific syntax rules. 
> Note: Some of these cheat sheets use additional packages that need to be downloaded and installed.

1. [Basic R Code](BasicRcode.pdf)
2. [RStudio Environment Guide](rstudio-ide.pdf)
3. [Some Syntax rules](syntax.pdf)
4. [Higher Level Syntax](r-cheat-sheet-3.pdf)
5. [Data Wrangling](data-wrangling-cheatsheet.pdf)
6. [Data Visualization](data-visualization-2.1.pdf)
7. [Data Visualization using ggplot2](ggplot2-cheatsheet.pdf)
8. [R Markdown Reference](rmarkdown-reference.pdf)
9. [R Markdown Cheat Sheet](rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf)

## New Software to use with R
The University of Auckland in New Zealand (birthplace of R) has a new program that allows users more of a "point and click" experience with R. It is called **iNZight** and you can download it for free [here](https://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/~wild/iNZight/install/). It is worth checking out if you have some time to play around.

Contact me if you have any questions. jmroith@stkate.edu

### Have fun with R/RStudio!!
